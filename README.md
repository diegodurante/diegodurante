### Hi there, I'm Diego ðŸ‘‹

In 2013 I **founded** Leevia holding the role of **Chief Technology Officer**. In ten years we have built a solid and profitable business in the **MarTech** sector by bringing our product to the market, a proprietary **Software as a Service** dedicated to brands that need to manage online contests to engage their communities by creating data enrichment and lead generation. Hundreds of the top brands from many different industries have trusted us, we have won numerous awards in both the startup and the marketing fields and we have managed thousands of contests in which millions of users from all over the world have participated. After ten years **the company was acquired** by one of our most important competitors.

I'm a passionate professional about **product lifecycle management** with frontline experience in **SaaS** products and **both B2B and B2C industries**. I'm excited to create new digital products involving cutting edge technologies and new business models. I have experience with the full lifecycle of complex products and the time and resource constraints associated with a new **product launch**. I am interested in **building empowered teams** within a great company culture, where people are trusted and encouraged to take initiative, share feedback and continuously learn. I love working with **agile methodologies** and am **detail-oriented** with a strong **focus on process improvement** and clear communication. I also love solving problems, analyzing data and making decisions with a **data-driven approach**. I believe in innovation, continuous improvement, automation, code quality and I worked with the best technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services, Linux, Git, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and more.

Specialties: Software Engineering, Engineering Management, Product Management, Team Management, Lean Startup, Agile Methodologies, Web Development, SaaS, Digital Marketing, Business Strategy.
